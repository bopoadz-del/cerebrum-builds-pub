"""Approval Rules - the human step between a proposed clearance rule and a
number an engineer will move a duct to satisfy, ported from <private-repo>
``app/rules/approval.py``.

A candidate rule is inert. It is stored, it is listed, it can be read - and
it cannot reach the rule table until a named person approves that specific
rule, by id. Approving a batch, approving by count, approving anything the
reviewer has not looked at individually: none of those exist here, because a
clearance figure is exactly the kind of thing that gets waved through when
the interface makes it easy to.

Every approval and every rejection is a ledger row. The question an engineer
will eventually ask about a rule is not "is it approved" but "who approved
it, when, and against what text", and only the ledger can answer that.

The donor writes its ledger rows through a SQLAlchemy session
(``app/ledger.record``). This block keeps approvals in-process with the
donor's exact semantics: everything arrives pending, decisions are one at a
time by id with a named reviewer, an anonymous approval is refused, and
every decision appends a ledger row with actor, states and clause text.
