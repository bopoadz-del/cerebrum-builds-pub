"""Fire protection & firefighting systems — the design-basis loader and the
live-state model.

The invariant pipeline itself has moved to the shared kit_engine evaluator
(``app/blocks/kit_engine``), driven declaratively by ``manifest.yaml`` and
``invariants.yaml`` in this directory. This module keeps only the two pieces
that are NOT part of the reasoning-layer vocabulary:

  FireProtectionBasis  the design-basis interview-gap loader (design_basis.yaml)
  SystemState          the two-source live-state model (impairment log +
                        live system status)

``vendor.cerebrum.blocks.fire_protection_reasoning`` (the store-facing wrapper) is the
host: it builds ``Figure`` objects from a query/answer/context and drives the
kit through its five hooks.
