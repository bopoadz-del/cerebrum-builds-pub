"""Railway & Metro Construction — domain module for the shared kit_engine.

The gate itself is declarative now: app/blocks/rail/manifest.yaml (vocabulary)
plus invariants.yaml (records), evaluated by vendor.cerebrum.blocks.kit_engine. Nothing in
the evaluator knows what a twist limit or a chainage is; this module supplies
the pieces the evaluator does not, and that the shared kinds cannot express:

  * TrackBasis   the track/civils design-basis LOADER (design_basis.yaml),
                  kept for interview/provenance bookkeeping — the values are
                  never consulted by the gate, only reported as gaps.
  * TrackState   the two-source live-state model (possession/signalling
                  system + manual log), reused by vendor.cerebrum.blocks.rail_reasoning
                  to build Figures and to surface live preconditions.
  * word-pattern regexes that classify a query/answer into the kit's
    vocabulary (extract_figures, in the portable spec's host-contract sense —
    the host, not the evaluator, knows the words for "twist limit").
  * DERIVATION_GUARD: four never-allowed inferences with NO declarative home
    in this engine. `derivation` (invariants.py) only checks stated-arithmetic
    consistency and same-quantity self-contradiction; neither is a hook for an
    arbitrary "forbidden phrase" pattern per record. These four stay
    host-side, evaluated directly against the combined query+answer+evidence
    text, exactly as before. (The other two never-allowed inferences — the
    category carry and the asset carry — DO have a declarative home: the
    `provenance` kind's carry-verb + distinct-value check, INV-RAIL-CATEGORY-
    CARRY / INV-RAIL-ASSET-CARRY in invariants.yaml.)
