"""Reference Corpus — a shared, read-only corpus that can never answer as a tenant's.

A tenant's corpus holds documents about THEIR asset. A reference corpus holds public
documents about other people's: government audits, official post-event reports,
governing-body standards. Both are useful and they must never be confused, because a
figure from another venue's audit presented as this venue's figure is the provenance
failure the whole reasoning layer exists to prevent.

WHAT THIS BLOCK IS NOT. It is not a second isolation mechanism.
``rag_tenant_isolation`` already implements STEP 0 -- a master corpus structurally
removed from the always-on merge and reachable only as a DISCLOSED fallback when the
active project is empty or thin. The reference corpus IS such a corpus, so this block
plans through that same rule rather than inventing a parallel one. What it adds is
the part STEP 0 does not cover: what may be admitted in the first place.

THE ADMISSION GATE. A write is refused unless the document carries every one of
``source_class``, ``publisher``, ``url``, ``sha256``, ``event``, ``edition_year`` and
``licence``. Not because a schema is tidy: an unlabelled document in a shared corpus
is a figure with no provenance that every tenant can reach.

THE LICENCE GATE is the one that matters most. ``licence: tenant_only`` can NEVER
enter the reference corpus, however it is labelled otherwise. The live case is the
SGSA Green Guide: the purchase licence is personal to the individual and allows three
downloads, so it can only ever be tenant-supplied. A block that admitted it would put
one person's licensed copy in front of every tenant.

MIRRORS ARE REFUSED. Scribd, SlideShare and their like are refused by host: the
official URL or the document stays out. A mirror is not a citation -- it is a copy of
unknown fidelity at an address the publisher does not control.

NAMED-ASSET QUERIES NEVER REACH IT. A question about a named venue or asset is
answered from tenant chunks only. The caller declares that it is asking about a named
asset; when the caller says nothing, this block assumes it IS -- reference is opt-in
and fallback-only, so ambiguity resolves toward the tenant's own documents rather
than toward someone else's.
