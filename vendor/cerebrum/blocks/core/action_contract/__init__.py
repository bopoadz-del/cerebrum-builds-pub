"""Generic domain-action contract runtime.

This package defines a domain-neutral, strongly typed contract for *actions*
(deliverable/analysis operations) that domain kits expose to a host runtime.

The contract is intentionally generic: the host runtime dispatches actions
purely by their registered :class:`ActionSpec`. Adding a new action to a kit
must never require editing a central dispatcher — the host discovers and
executes actions through :class:`ActionRegistry` and :func:`execute_action`.

Public surface:

* :class:`ActionStatus`     – closed status enum
* :class:`ActionContext`    – trusted runtime context (never model-supplied)
* :class:`ActionDependency` – a missing pre-condition
* :class:`ActionEvidence`   – a citation/evidence reference
* :class:`ActionOutcome`    – what a handler returns
* :class:`ActionSpec`       – the action declaration
* :class:`ActionResult`     – the serialized execution record
* :class:`ActionRegistry`   – discovery + resolution
* :func:`execute_action`    – the generic execution engine
