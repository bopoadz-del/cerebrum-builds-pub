"""The shared evaluator: five hooks, a hard budget, fail-closed loading.

    question
       ├─ H0  PRE-RETRIEVAL ... scope       refuse without searching
    retrieval
       ├─ H1  RANKING ......... authority   lift the governing class
    tool calls
       ├─ H2  TOOL-TIME ....... unit_discipline · band
    answer draft
       ├─ H3  ANSWER-TIME ..... grounding · qualifier · provenance ·
       │                        currency · derivation · unit_discipline
    deliverable
       └─ H4  EXPORT-TIME ..... re-run H3 on the file before it leaves

Two hooks for unit_discipline, not one, is the load-bearing decision: H2 alone
misses figures the model states without a tool, and H3 alone lets corrupted
values reach exports and source panels before anyone checks. H4 exists for the
same reason one layer further out.

**Budget, non-negotiable.** O(figures × applicable invariants), a hard cap, no
materialised closures, and a check that SKIPS AND LOGS when exceeded. An
unbounded set in exactly this position consumed 2 GB and killed a live instance
twice in one day. A skipped check is not a pass, and ``Outcome.incomplete``
says so, so a host cannot present it as one.

**Fail closed** means one specific thing, and it is the opposite of what a
careless loader does: a kit that does not parse is DISABLED, and a disabled kit
**refuses every statement**. It never loads with zero invariants and waves
everything through — that is a kit with a typo becoming a kit with no gates.
Each kit also has a kill switch (``CEREBRUM_KIT_<NAME>=off``), so a bad kit is
one restart from off rather than one deploy.
