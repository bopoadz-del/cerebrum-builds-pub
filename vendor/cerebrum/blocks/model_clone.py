"""model_clone — the agent works on a branch, never on the drawing of record.

THE INVARIANT THIS BLOCK EXISTS TO HOLD: the original IFC is opened read-only
and is byte-identical afterwards. Everything else here is convenience; that is
the promise. A coordination agent that can silently edit the model of record is
not a tool an engineer can accept, however good its geometry.

So the output to the engineer is a CHANGE SET plus BCF issues, applied by them
in their own authoring tool. This block never applies anything to a live model.

TWO PATHS, and the fallback is not a lesser one:
  * Speckle (preferred) — a stream per model version, a branch per zone,
    proposals committed as object patches. Gives versioning and diffs for free
    and is what B7 consumes. Requires a server URL and token, which are
    owner-gated infrastructure, so it is OPTIONAL at import time.
  * IFC round-trip (always available) — writes a MODIFIED COPY beside the
    original and emits change_set.json. This is the path that runs today.

Speckle being unavailable is recorded as a BLOCKED line naming its unblocker,
not hidden and not worked around by pretending the copy is a stream.

READS   the original IFC; proposals from clash_resolver.
WRITES  a modified COPY, change_set.json, and (when configured) Speckle commits.
NEVER   writes the original model. Enforced by hash assertion in the tests, and
        by never opening the original in a write mode anywhere in this file.
