"""Android Drive Block — Android storage access.

CAPABILITY GAP (survey wave-2 close-out): the block is an honest stub.
A real implementation needs net-new ADB (or a device REST bridge)
integration — no donor exists in the surveyed repos. Until then every
operation refuses by name and returns no device data. Classified:
store_upgrade / net-new-capability.
