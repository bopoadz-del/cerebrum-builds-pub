"""cosmetic and aesthetic clinics reasoning kit — store-facing block.

Identity only. Every rule this block enforces is DECLARED in
``app/blocks/aesthetic/manifest.yaml`` (vocabulary) and ``invariants.yaml``
(records), and evaluated by the shared reasoning layer in
``app/blocks/kit_engine``. Nothing domain-specific lives in this file, which is
the point: sixteen hand-written gates is sixteen chances to order the rules
wrong, and one evaluator reading one declaration cannot.

Values are NOT filled — no interview has run for this domain. The block reports
``interview_status`` and ``unfilled_figures`` with every answer, and refuses
rather than supplying a figure it does not have.
