"""sports venue reasoning kit — store-facing block.

Identity only. Every rule this block enforces is DECLARED in
``app/blocks/stadium_venue/manifest.yaml`` (vocabulary) and ``invariants.yaml``
(records), and evaluated by the shared reasoning layer in
``app/blocks/kit_engine``. Nothing domain-specific lives in this file, which is
the point: forty-three hand-written gates is forty-three chances to order the
rules wrong, and one evaluator reading one declaration cannot.

The archetypes are why this is not "one stadium". A fixed championship venue, a
multi-tenant venue, a single-purpose venue and a TOURING event that is a guest in
someone else's building each mean something different by the same number, and
carrying a figure between them is the defect this kit exists to catch.

Values are NOT filled — no interview has run for this domain. The block reports
``interview_status`` and its figure register with every answer, and refuses rather
than supplying a figure it does not have.
