"""The base class that makes a block's failures visible, and the free
function that does the same for a block that has not adopted it yet.

ADDITIVE BY CONSTRUCTION
------------------------
``UniversalBlock`` is not touched, and neither is any block in
``app/blocks/``. ``execute()`` keeps its envelope and its ``success``/
``error`` vocabulary, so every existing caller and every existing test sees
exactly what it saw before.

Two ways in, and the second is the important one:

``ContractBlock``
    A new block subclasses this instead of ``UniversalBlock`` and returns a
    :class:`~vendor.cerebrum.core.block_result.BlockResult` from ``process``. It gets the
    exception guard for free.

:func:`safe_call`
    Runs **any** ``UniversalBlock`` -- adopted or not, written years ago --
    and returns a ``BlockResult``. Nothing about the block changes. This is
    what the store-wide conformance harness uses to get a status out of 129
    blocks that have never heard of this module.

WHY THE GUARD RE-RAISES ONLY ON A FLAG
--------------------------------------
Catching every exception and reporting ``failed`` is right in production: a
raised exception that escapes a block takes down whatever was orchestrating
it, and the reader learns nothing about which block failed or why.

It is wrong in a debugger. So ``reraise_exceptions`` exists, defaults to
``False``, and when set lets the exception through untouched -- after the
result has been built, so the two paths cannot disagree about what happened.

The flag is read from the block's config, not from ``os.environ``: block code
does not reach into the environment (see the Config injection work in L2.5).
