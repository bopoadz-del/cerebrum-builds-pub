"""Tier × block access control for the public block surface.

The audit found that a single API key reaches every registered block via
`/v1/execute`, `/chain`, and `/mcp`. Blocks like `code`, `sandbox`,
`formula_executor`, `secrets`, `database`, `web`, `webhook`,
`file_hasher`, `storage`, `email`, and `billing` are RCE / SSRF / FS
traversal / vault-read primitives. Combined with the public-tier API
key shipped in the SPA bundle, that's a server-compromise vector.

This module defines the set of blocks that require the `unlimited` tier
(master / dev keys only) and the helper `enforce_block_access` used by
the route handlers.

Override at runtime by setting `CEREBRUM_RESTRICTED_BLOCKS` to a
comma-separated list. To open a normally-restricted block to standard
tier, prefix with `-`:

    CEREBRUM_RESTRICTED_BLOCKS=-email,my_custom_dangerous_block
