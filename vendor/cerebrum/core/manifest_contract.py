"""The contract fields on ``block.json``: what a block needs, what it
produces, and how it fails.

KERNEL_DEFAULTS 1.2, extending #84. Every field here is **optional**. A
manifest that declares none of them is valid, which is why all 114 manifests
in this repo still pass unchanged.

WHY OPTIONAL, AND WHAT BREAKS WHEN THEY ARE NOT
-----------------------------------------------
"If you assign it, you feed it" is only enforceable at plan time if
``requires_inputs`` and ``preconditions`` are declared. But the planner
cannot be taught to require a field that no manifest carries yet, and only a
kit's author can honestly assert what their block needs -- inferring it from
code would manufacture exactly the confident-but-unsourced claim this whole
contract exists to prevent.

So the field lands first, empty, and is filled by authors. The flip from
optional to required is a separate PR, after P7, with the owner's tick.

THE SIGNATURE PROBLEM, AND WHY THESE FIELDS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DIGEST
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``BlockSigner._compute_digests`` hashes the canonical JSON of ``block.json``.
Any new key changes that JSON, which would invalidate all 114 existing
signatures -- and the private key is not in this repo, so nothing could be
re-signed.

#84 hit this with ``trust_tier`` and solved it by stripping the field before
hashing. The same treatment is applied here, for the same reason and with the
same limit: the fields are checked by the validator but not yet covered by
the signature, until the operator re-signs.

Because no manifest in the repo carries any of these fields today, adding
them to the strip list leaves every existing digest byte-for-byte identical.
There is a test that recomputes all 114 and proves it.

RELATIONSHIP TO THE FIELDS THAT ALREADY EXIST
---------------------------------------------
``inputs`` / ``outputs`` are already on every manifest, and are NOT the same
claim. They are UI-and-config derived -- generated from a block's
``default_config``, with ``required: false`` on essentially everything -- and
they describe what the form should render. ``requires_inputs`` and
``produces`` are the runtime contract: what must be present for the block to
do its work at all, and what a caller can rely on getting back. Conflating
them is why a planner can assign a block it cannot feed.

``version`` is already required on all 114 manifests (see
``scripts/audit_block_standards.REQUIRED_MANIFEST_KEYS``) and is therefore
not redefined here.

DISPATCH DECLARATIONS (``capability_class`` / ``factory_attach``)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Factory used to branch on block ids (``if bid == "workflow"``). It now
branches on what a block declares: ``capability_class`` (one word from
:data:`CAPABILITY_CLASSES`) picks how a caller shapes the block's input,
``factory_attach`` says whether the Factory may attach the block at all,
``preconditions[].ensure`` names a resource the block mints and the id a
caller must carry, and ``requires_inputs[].satisfied_by`` names the caller
fields that feed a need. All four are inside the signature.

``trust_tier`` is pinned in :mod:`vendor.cerebrum.core.trust_tier` and consumed, never
restated -- two copies of an accepted-value set drift, and the failure mode
of that drift is a block that one checker admits and another rejects.

L2.2 BRIEF-SCOPE FIELDS (``reads`` / ``writes`` / ``never`` / ``acceptance``)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These four fields are what the Factory brief compiler reads for STEP 0
inventory (READS / WRITES / NEVER / ACCEPTANCE). They are **report-only
until the flip**.

``BRIEF_SCOPE_FAIL_CLOSED`` is ``False`` in this phase. Lane 2 and the
store audit *report* missing or invalid brief-scope fields; they do not
fail the store on an empty or partial backfill. Absence is not an error
in ``check_contract_fields`` (the fail-closed validator). A later
owner-gated PR flips ``BRIEF_SCOPE_FAIL_CLOSED`` to ``True`` after
leftovers are gone -- do not flip it here.

Empty lists are valid and mean "measured, nothing claimed" or "could not
be measured honestly". Fabricating a scope the block's code does not
touch is the defect these fields exist to prevent.
