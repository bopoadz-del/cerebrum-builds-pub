"""Settings a block is GIVEN, never settings a block goes looking for.

KERNEL_DEFAULTS 1.5.

THE RULE
--------
Block code does not call ``os.getenv``. It reads what it was handed.

This is not tidiness. A block that reaches into the environment cannot be
constructed twice with different settings, cannot be tested against a second
configuration without mutating the process, and -- the expensive one -- gives
no answer to "what does this block need in order to run?" other than reading
its source. That question is what a generated zip has to answer on a stranger's
laptop before it boots.

There are 31 block modules in ``app/blocks/`` making 85 such calls today. This
PR does not change them; it lands the pattern and applies it to one block. The
rest are ordered in the L2.6 migration plan.

THE FALLBACK LADDER
-------------------
Every external dependency has a local fallback, so a zip boots on a laptop
with zero services running:

===================  =====================  =================================
dependency           preferred              fallback
===================  =====================  =================================
cache                Redis                  in-process dict
relational store     PostgreSQL             SQLite file
object store         S3-compatible bucket   local directory
language model       provider API           stub returning ``refused``
===================  =====================  =================================

The LLM rung is the one that matters most and is the easiest to get wrong.
The fallback is NOT a canned answer or a smaller model -- it is a stub that
returns :data:`~vendor.cerebrum.core.block_result.REFUSED` with a reason saying no model
was configured. A fallback that answers anyway converts "this platform has no
LLM" into "this platform is confidently wrong", which is the failure class
the whole contract exists to prevent.

DEGRADING IS NOT THE SAME AS PRETENDING
---------------------------------------
A block on a fallback rung must say so. :meth:`Config.backend` returns the
rung that was actually taken so the block can report it, and
:func:`fallback_note` turns that into a line a reader can act on. Silently
serving from an in-process dict while the caller believes it is talking to
Redis is how a cache "works" in testing and loses every write in production.
